# SVM ALGORITHM

## SVM.py:
* Input: document-term matrix
* Output: trained model and predictions with model
* Overview: Contains an svm class use to build, train and predict a given data set. It also has a function
            for creating the confusion matrix

## Packages:
The following packages are required:
* numpy for scientific computing
* pandas for loading files
* scipy for mathematics, science and engineering calculations


## CITATIONS:
I consulted a matlab code from Machine Learning course on coursera taught by Stanford University professor
Andrew Ng.
